# Community Free Resources for Devs

A simple, beginner-friendly web page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that collects and organizes the best free resources for developers — tools, courses, icons, stock images, learning platforms, and more.

Main goal of the project  

-Serve as an easy starting point for people learning web development  
-Make it super simple for absolute beginners to make their first contribution on GitHub  
-Help people gain real experience with HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub Pull Requests, and open-source collaboration

How the page works

Resources are filtered using tags (buttons at the top).
Clicking a tag like "Design" shows only resources that include the design tag in their data-tags attribute.Current tags (buttons):  

-All  
-Design  
-Programming  
-Courses  
-Icons  
-Images

You can easily add new tags and new resources!

# How to Contribute

Option 1: Add a new resource (the easiest and most common way to start)

1.-Click the Fork button (top right) — this creates your own copy of the project.  

2.-In your fork, open the file index.html  

3.-Scroll down to the section that looks like this:

<img width="442" height="52" alt="Captura de pantalla 2026-02-21 143308" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0235a85d-6fc9-4674-989b-8108e93fd49a" />


4.-Copy-paste one of the existing blocks and edit it with your recommendation. Example:
<img width="579" height="137" alt="Captura de pantalla 2026-02-21 143203" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/070a9e7c-aa53-4a97-b1b0-2d3dc0d1e83a" />


Important rules for tags:
 
-Separate tags with commas (no spaces): frontend,react,javascript  
-No trailing comma at the end  
-If the tag doesn't exist yet → you can create it!

5.-If you want to add a new tag, also add a new button in this section:

<img width="456" height="253" alt="Captura de pantalla 2026-02-21 143351" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9086c2c-a39b-41a9-9353-1f3458cb6a5f" />


6.-Save your changes → Commit them (good commit message example: "Add Python for Everybody course")  

7.-Go to Pull Requests → New pull request → Create pull request  

8.-Write a short description of what you added and submit!

# Contribution Guidelines

-Use lowercase tags with no spaces or accents (e.g. frontend, machine-learning, free-tools)  
-Links should open in new tabs (target="_blank")  
-Write short, clear descriptions  
-Only recommend truly free resources (or freemium with good free tier)  
-No paid courses disguised as free, no spam, no broken links  
-Be kind and respectful in issues and pull requests

# Thank you for contributing!

Even the smallest pull request helps a lot — especially for people doing their very first contribution.
This project is intentionally made easy so everyone can join and learn.
